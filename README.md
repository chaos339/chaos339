<h1> Welcome, Glad you could come!</h1>
<h6>Hi! Iâ€™m @chaos339. Or you can call me Malks. It's like my first name in real life but I think this sounds cooler. This is also my username on my other accounts so yeah.</h6>
<h2>ðŸ“‹Interests: </h2>
<h6>Iâ€™m interested in learning different programming languages such as: </h6>
<h6><ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
</ul></h6>
<h6>There's a lot more that I want to learn and improve. </h6>
<h2>ðŸ¤”About Me: </h2>
<h6>Iâ€™m currently learning Lua during my semester break. Yes, I'm still studying, I'm currently a second year IT student somewhere in Asia. I'm trying to get a hold of Lua language
during my spare time since I heard that the institute/college that I am going to is not planning on teaching it (AND MANY MORE... sad). So yeah, the only way to learn something
that will not be taught is to `self-study` it. </h6>

<h6>I have a bit of experience in C++, Javascript, C# (Very Little), HTML, CSS. Most of the programming languages I've stated is the ones that was taught in my college. Although, if
I am going to be honest, I had to self-study most of it since... I don't know... its just that they did not really teach it well. (Me and most of my blockmates had a hard time). </h6>
