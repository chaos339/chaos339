<h1> Welcome, Glad you could come!</h1>
<h6>Hi! I’m @chaos339. Or you can call me Malks. It's like my first name in real life but I think this sounds cooler. This is also my username on my other accounts so yeah.</h6>
<h2>📋Interests: </h2>
<h6>I’m interested in learning different programming languages such as: </h6>
<h6><ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
</ul></h6>
<h6>There's a lot more that I want to learn and improve. </h6>
<h2>🤔About Me: </h2>
<h6>I’m currently learning Lua during my semester break. Yes, I'm still studying, I'm currently a second year IT student somewhere in Asia. I'm trying to get a hold of Lua language
during my spare time since I heard that the institute/college that I am going to is not planning on teaching it (AND MANY MORE... sad). So yeah, the only way to learn something
that will not be taught is to `self-study` it. </h6>

<h6>I have a bit of experience in C++, Javascript, C# (Very Little), HTML, CSS. Most of the programming languages I've stated is the ones that was taught in my college. Although, if
I am going to be honest, I had to self-study most of it since... I don't know... its just that they did not really teach it well. (Me and most of my blockmates had a hard time). </h6>

<h2>🛠️ What I Am Working On At The Moment: </h2>
<h6><ul>
  <li>HTML with Bootstrap, I develop simple websites for students who are well... Unfortuante I guess. As long as they pay up, its all good business.</li>
  <li>Currently studying Lua FiveM development (GTA 5 Rp Mod). I got really interested on how things work in GTA Rp so I decided, why not give it a try? And here I am, trying to
    get a hold of Lua scripting and a bit of Javascript</li>
  <li>Some commissions using the C++ language.</li>
</h6></ul>

<h2>🔎 Future Plans: </h2>
<h6><ul>
  <li>I would try uploading some of my HTML websites that I've developed here in my github. The only ones that I will upload is probably the ones that I'm sure I will not update
    anymore since I do not plan uploading some samples that I will still use for commissions. Guy's gonna need those cash mah peeps</li>
  <li>I plan to upload more of my sample scripts here that I finish for everyone to use. Figured that some people actually use some scripts I did since I got some messages in my
    discord.</li>
</h6></ul>
